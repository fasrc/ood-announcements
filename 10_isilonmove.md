**IMPORTANT PLEASE READ:** 
<br>**HOME DIRECTORY MOVE**: As part of our work to consolidate
space in our datacenters we are physically moving
the Isilon that hosts the home directories to a new
rack.  This move will take place on **July 20th** and take
all day to accomplish. It will require a **full outage of
the cluster and login nodes**.  All running jobs will be
cancelled. Please plan accordingly.  For more detals see:
