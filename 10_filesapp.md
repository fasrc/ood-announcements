**NOTICE:** NEW SCRATCH: Our new global scratch is live! Please move your jobs over to /n/netscratch as holyscratch01 will be retired soon.<br>

**NOTICE:** The OOD Files page now shows the /n/netscratch path instead of the /n/holyscratch01 path.<br>
Please move any files you currently have in holyscratch01 to the equivalent location under netscratch.<br>
You can still use the "Change directory" button in the Files view to navigate to /n/holyscratch01/<your lab>.<br>
